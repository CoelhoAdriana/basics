                    <p> 1. In nature, <strong> nothing is perfect </strong> and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they're still beautiful. <i> –Alice Walker</i>
                       <br> 2. Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair. <i> —Khalil Gibran</i>
                       <br> 3. Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better. <i> —Albert Einstein</i>
                       <br> 4. Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads. <i> —Henry David Thoreau</i>
                       <br> 5. To me a lush carpet of pine needles or spongy grass is more welcome than the most luxurious Persian rug. <i> —Helen Keller</i>
                       <br> 6. We don't inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children. <i> —Native American proverb</i>
                       <br> 7. I believe in God, only <em> I spell it Nature</em>. <i> —Frank Lloyd Wright</i>
                                                <br>(...)
                        <br> 101. <i> Rest is not idleness</i>, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time. <i> —John Lubbock</i>
